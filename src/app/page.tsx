              <p>Good morning, everyone! Let me introduce myself. I’m Thành Luân. My full name is Nguyễn Thành Luân. I have been working as a web developer since my graduation from Quy Nhon College Of Engineering And Technology in 2016. As I have stated in my CV, I have cooperated with a few small-sized and medium-sized companies and also worked on my personal projects. I believe what has helped me gain credibility are my good professional skills and my punctuality. I always put my heart and soul into every single website that I develop. I guess that’s all I have to share about myself. Thank you for listening!</p>
